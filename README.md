# Encryption & Decryption Tool

This web application provides a simple interface to encrypt and decrypt text using different algorithms. The backend is implemented in Go (Golang) and handles encryption and decryption operations securely.

## Features

- **Encryption Algorithms**: Supports AES encryption.
- **Decryption Algorithms**: Supports AES decryption.
- **User Interface**: Simple HTML form for inputting text, selecting algorithms, and entering keys.
- **Secure Communication**: Uses HTTP POST requests to securely communicate with the backend.

## Requirements

- Go (Golang) installed on your system.
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the frontend.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
Start the Go backend server:

bash
Copy code: go run backend.go
Ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:8080.

Open frontend.html in your web browser:

Double-click on frontend.html or drag it into your browser window.
Usage
Enter text into the textarea.
Select an operation (Encrypt or Decrypt) from the dropdown.
Enter the encryption/decryption key into the input field.
Click the "Submit" button.
The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed below.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the interface looks:


Notes
Make sure to handle encryption keys securely and avoid exposing them in client-side code or unsecured connections.
For production use, consider deploying the backend on a secure server with HTTPS.
